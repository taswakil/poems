                    As a river flows,
                    it begins to change.
                    And that is why rivers 
                    Never stay the same
                    And just like a river
                    My current shift each day
                    And the wat I am right now
                    Might not always remain 
                    So if you are searching 
                    For the girl I use to be
                    She was washed always
                    All the way out of the sea
                 </p>

                <h4>Bachul Junejo</h4>
                <p style="font-size: large; line-height: 1.3em;" >
                    No clue about the future
                    No regret about what is gone
                    Trusting the signs of nature
                    I have embarked on my own.
                    Indeed, I am little afraid of the waves
                    And I know, how much flawed is my boat
                    But I will reach my place, regardless of the days
                    So with faith and flaws, I float. With faith and flaws, I float.
                    With faith and flaws, I float.

                <h1>Fear </h1>
                <h4>Khalil Gibran</h4>
                <p >
                    
It is said that before entering the sea
a river trembles with fear.

She looks back at the path she has traveled,
from the peaks of the mountains,
the long winding road crossing forests and villages.

And in front of her,
she sees an ocean so vast,
that to enter
there seems nothing more than to disappear forever.

But there is no other way.
The river can not go back.

Nobody can go back.
To go back is impossible in existence.

The river needs to take the risk
of entering the ocean
because only then will fear disappear,
because that's where the river will know
it's not about disappearing into the ocean,
but of becoming the ocean.
